# 003 EMBER transceiver bring-up

**Status:** In progress  
**Started:** 2026-10-15  
**Updated:** 2026-10-15

The EMBER transceiver PCB arrived today. I am bringing it up in stages, starting
with unpowered checks before testing the supplies, controller, CAN interfaces,
and RF paths.

## Initial inspection and setup

I inspected the board under the microscope and did not see any solder bridges.
That is a visual observation; electrical shorts and assembly correctness have
not yet been ruled out by measurement.

The Pico and H1/H2 headers are not installed. Nothing has been connected to
the board: no supply, USB, or external interfaces. A multimeter and a NANKADF
current-limited bench supply are available. The supply model, multimeter model,
and individual board identifier have not yet been recorded. I plan to solder
one temporary power pin and one ground pin for the first tests.

## Unpowered supply resistance

With the Pico absent and the board disconnected, I measured:

| Measurement | Reported resistance |
| --- | --- |
| Meter probes touched together | 0.34 Ω |
| Across C117 — input 5 V to GND | 20 kΩ |
| Across C58 — protected 5 V to GND | 359 kΩ |
| Across C59 — 3.3 V to GND | 20 kΩ |

These readings do not indicate a hard short on the three measured rails. They
do not yet establish correct powered operation. The reported readings were taken after approximately 10 seconds of settling.
Initial readings and actual probe polarity were not separately recorded; no
lead-resistance correction has been applied.

## Next check

The ordered-board pad record identifies H2 pads 25/26 as input `+5V_CON` and
H2 pads 29–32 as GND. Proposed temporary connections are H2 pad 25 for positive
and pad 29 for ground. Before connecting the supply, verify continuity from the
positive pin to C117 pad 1 and from the ground pin to C117 pad 2. Check the
physical pad numbering rather than counting from an assumed viewing side.

Pin installation and those continuity checks have not yet been reported. Then
establish the bench voltage/current limit for first power, with the Pico and
external interfaces still disconnected. No power-on results are recorded.
